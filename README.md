## Learning Goals 
* My goals for this project were to solidify my knowledge of basic data cleaning, and to practice visualizations for data subsets with multiple categories.

## Background
* This is synthetic data for a made up cafe, created by kaggle user ahmedmohamed2003. It's shape is (10000, 7), containing three categorical columns, 3 numerical, and one datetime.

## Reflections
* Overall, I am pleased with the results of this project. I learned a lot about subsetting data, analysis of missing values, and visualizations.
* In the future, I would like to learn how I can properly simplify a time series graph. My time series visualizations very cluttered. I did experiment with visualizing random samples of the data, and sorting the values by date, then taking every 10th row. These methods appeared to work with quantity by location, however when I tried it on a more complicated problem: quantity by item by location, it drastically changed the data.
